# description: "This is my custom landing page."
# Crucial Setting: Tell the homepage listing to ignore the 'posts' section
# PaperMod (and Hugo) will often use 'main' to query all content.
# By setting 'mainSections' to an empty array or a section that doesn't exist,
# you override the automatic listing of all your posts.

Hi there! I'm Hanbin Zhou, currently a M.Sc. student at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu).
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net).

My research interests generally lie in designing practical and adaptive machine learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees,
especially in online/reinforcement learning under adversarial/multi-agent environment.

You can find my CV [here]().

You can reach me at:
