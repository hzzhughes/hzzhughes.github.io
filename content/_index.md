# PaperMod (and Hugo) will often use 'main' to query all content.
# By setting 'mainSections' to an empty array or a section that doesn't exist,

Hi there! I'm Hanbin Zhou, currently a M.Sc. student at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu).
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Haipeng Luo](https://haipeng-luo.net).

My research interests generally lie in designing practical and adaptive machine learning algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees,
especially in online/reinforcement learning under adversarial/multi-agent environment.
