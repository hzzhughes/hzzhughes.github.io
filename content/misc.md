layout: "home" # Use PaperMod's home layout
# description: "This is my custom landing page."
# Crucial Setting: Tell the homepage listing to ignore the 'posts' section
# PaperMod (and Hugo) will often use 'main' to query all content.
# By setting 'mainSections' to an empty array or a section that doesn't exist,
# you override the automatic listing of all your posts.
